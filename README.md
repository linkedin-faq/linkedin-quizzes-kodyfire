### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire)

## Requirements

linkedin-quizzes-kodyfire requires the [kodyfire-cli](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire) to be installed

```sh
npm install -g kodyfire-cli
```
## Install

```sh
npm install linkedin-quizzes-kodyfire
```

## Usage

### Method 1: As a generator
In order to generate your artifacts, run the `generate` command. The syntax is `kody generate|g [kody] [concept]`. If you ommit `kody` and `concept` the assistant will prompt you to select them. As an example, run the following command from your terminal:
```sh
kody generate linkedin-quizzes
```
### Method 2: As a runner in a kody project
Refer to the kodyfire __[generate your artifact](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire#generate-your-artifact)__ section.
Once your project is initialized and ready for kody,
generate your linkedin-quizzes concept using the `kody ride` command or manually. As an example, A declaration for a linkedin-quizzes concept might look like the following: 
```json
{
	"name": "javascript",
	"showAnswer": true,
	"showCorrectAnswer": true,
	"showReference": true,
	"showScore": true
}
```

After adding your concept(s) definitions, run the following command to generate your assets.

```sh
kody run -s kody-linkedin-quizzes.json
```
